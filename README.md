# Fizz-Buzz-in-Python
This Python script implements the classic Fizz Buzz problem. It prints the numbers from 1 to 100, but for multiples of three, it outputs "Fizz" instead of the number, and for multiples of five, it outputs "Buzz". For numbers that are multiples of both three and five, it outputs "FizzBuzz".
